# Unifying_Engine-Demo
This is a very small demo of how a machine learning unifying engine would work 
on the very minimum level involving just some functions. This is isnspired by the repository unifyai/ivy.

As more functionality is added, this will demand more work and as full neural network is supported 
it will require stateful classes and gradient support. This is besides the complexities arising from dtype differences,
argument differences and device handling amongst other nuiances. This
